## Features to implement

* [`redux-persist`](https://github.com/rt2zz/redux-persist) to persist state to local storage
* [`react-loadable`](https://github.com/jamiebuilds/react-loadable) to load components with dynamic imports (code splitting made simple)
* [`react-intl`](https://github.com/yahoo/react-intl) to translate the app
  * Dev dependencies: `storybook-addon-intl`
* [`Moment`](https://github.com/moment/moment) or [`Luxon`](https://github.com/moment/luxon) to work with dates and times
